# NLP Project
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p>In this project, I would be examing the title and descriptions of articles from Pew Research Websites by extracting key words through larg languages model to identify the top concerned issues and topics among immigrants living or planning to come to US. Therefore, it would help politicians to better connect with immigrant communities, especially hispanics.
</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The info was scraped from Pew Research website, which is an research website ran by a group of think tank based in washington. They tend to offer unbiased research results without taking any policy stand.
</li>
  <li> The info will be processed through LLM algorithms and clustered by KMeans and insights wil be extracted by the results given.
</li>
  <li>A pretrained model called BertTopic will be appled to train the data sets and different insights will be presented.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The challenges and future improvments.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The topics I focus is too broad, and I should have focused on a much specific topic.</li>
  <li>If the topic is narrow, then I should focus on the articles rather than just the title and description.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thanks for reading.</h3>
